## what's useful in this repo?

I personally use the "correcteur" binary as a server for a chrome extension that helps me correct my French mistakes. I wrote this because i'm pretty annoyed that when I write something in Markdown, I have to remove the Markdown language stuff from my text to be able to copy and paste it into a grammar/spell checking tool. With this, I can just select the precise text I want to correct.

*(I should do the same for my broken english....)*
